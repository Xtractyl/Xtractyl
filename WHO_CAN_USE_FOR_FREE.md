# Who can use Xtractyl for free? (Plain‑Language Guide)

This page explains your rights under the **Xtractyl Non‑Commercial License v1.2** in simple terms.  
If anything here conflicts with the license text, the **license text wins**.

## TL;DR
- **Free** for clearly **non‑commercial** use.
- **Not automatically free** for public institutions or NGOs — **ask us first**.
- When in doubt, **email us**. We’ll confirm in writing whether your use counts as non‑commercial.

## Free (Non‑Commercial) examples
- Personal learning, demos, hackathons with no fees.
- Academic research by a university lab **without** paid deliverables.
- Teaching in a classroom where students don’t pay for Xtractyl.
- Non‑profit internal evaluation **not tied to paid projects**.

## Not free (Commercial) examples
- Use inside a **for‑profit company** to build products, deliver services, or gain business advantage.
- Consultants or agencies using Xtractyl in **paid work** for clients.
- Hosting Xtractyl as part of a **paid platform or feature**.
- Creating reports/datasets with Xtractyl that you **sell**.

## Public sector & NGOs (important)
Public research institutions, government agencies, and non‑profits **are not automatically “free.”**  
They **may** be classified as non‑commercial **after we confirm it in writing** or agree a special term.

> If you’re in this category, please contact us with a short description of your use case (see template below).

## Quick decision guide
1. **Are you getting paid or expecting business advantage?** → You **need** a commercial license.
2. **Unsure or public/NGO?** → Email us; we’ll confirm whether it’s free or propose a license.
3. **Just learning or doing non‑paid research?** → You’re likely fine under non‑commercial use.

## How to request confirmation (or a commercial license)
