Models Used:

This project may use local LLMs such as `gemma3:12b` with the Ollama runtime.  
**Important**: These models are distributed under their own licenses and usage restrictions.  
You are responsible for reviewing and complying with the license and usage terms of any  
model you load via Ollama.

- For example, Gemma models are released by Google under the [Gemma License Agreement](https://ai.google.dev/gemma).
- Some models may be for **non-commercial use only** or **research purposes**.

This project does **not** include any pre-downloaded models.  
Instead, it provides tools to run models via Ollama, assuming you have the legal right to do so.
